🧬 Biomedical Waste Segregation Game

An interactive, browser-based educational game designed to improve biomedical waste segregation awareness among healthcare professionals, students, and support staff.

This game transforms mandatory compliance training into an engaging, measurable learning experience, helping healthcare facilities reduce segregation errors, improve regulatory compliance, and strengthen patient and staff safety.

🎯 Purpose

Improper biomedical waste segregation is one of the most common compliance failures in healthcare facilities.
This game aims to:

Reinforce correct waste segregation practices

Reduce human error through repetition and feedback

Make training engaging instead of passive

Provide a digital, scalable alternative to classroom-only training

🕹️ Game Overview

Players are presented with various waste items commonly generated in healthcare settings and must correctly place them into the appropriate biomedical waste category within a time limit.

Core Mechanics

Multiple difficulty levels (Easy / Medium / Hard)

Countdown-based gameplay

Real-time feedback on correct and incorrect segregation

Score tracking and performance summary at the end of each session

🗂️ Waste Categories Covered

The game is aligned with standard biomedical waste segregation rules:

🟡 Yellow – Infectious & pathological waste

🔴 Red – Contaminated recyclable waste

⚪ White (Translucent) – Sharps

🔵 Blue – Glassware & metallic implants

(Categories can be extended or customized as per local regulations.)

📊 Learning Outcomes
